Just a little test I did for Yaw Game Studios.
It's a card game called Blade that is a minigame in a JRPG I like called The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel.
You play the cards, always looking to top your enemy score every turn, using number cards and special cards that have different effects.

Use the mouse to play, clicking on the card you want to play when it's your turn.
Start on the Title scene and use the menus to go where you need to.
